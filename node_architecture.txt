step-1 client/user

step-2 clients send many request

step-3  that request goes under event queue

step-4  that event queue send all the request to event loop but one by one - and it is first come first serve  

step-5 it(event loop) check that request is blocking operation that is nothink but sync and non blocking operation that is Async 

step-6 if its non blocking operation then it proces .that generated respose send to client back 

step-7 or if its blocking the that request goes under thread pool 
(thread pool is contain multiple threads okay and we can assume that thread is worker which do work for us)
imp - threads are limited

step-8 suppos we write  blocking code okay and there are many user which are visiting our site but we have limited number o thread suppose 
 suppos we have 4 thread

 step-9 1st user send request so 1 thread is asign to that user like this all thread will asign for 1st 4 user then what about others they will be in waiting 
 because after compliting task then only thread can take the next user request it which very much time cansuming and also me be our site will be crash

 step-10  so its good to write code in non blocking
